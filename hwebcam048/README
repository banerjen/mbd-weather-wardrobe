Hello and thank you for downloading my webcam capture program!

hwebcam is a simple program that lets you capture a video stream from a
uvc-compatible webcam and display it to the screen or save it in Ogg/Theora
format. Optionally, audio from the built-in microphone present in many webcams
can also be captured and encoded in Vorbis. The resulting Ogg file can be saved
and/or streamed through the net using icecast.

These are some of the things you can do with hwebcam:

  a) Capture and display a video in a sdl window
  b) Capture and save a picture every n video frames (or every frame)
  c) Save the captured video stream in Ogg/Theora format to an output file,
     or send it to stdout
  d) Same as previous point, but also including Vorbis audio

Of course you can do, for example, a and b together, or a and d together.

Note: hwebcam supports capturing from webcams in raw (YUYV) mode, mjpeg mode or
jpeg mode using streaming I/O. The images are saved in Portable Pix Map (ppm)
format when capturing in raw mode and in jpeg format when capturing in mjpeg/jpeg
mode.

2. How to compile hwebcam
-------------------------

hwebcam is written in C an uses the v4l2 api to access the webcam, along
with several external libraries to do the encoding/decoding stuff. Since
it is still a relatively simple program, there is no configure script.
In order to compile hwebcam you need:

  1) gcc
  2) make
  3) libsdl (optional)
  4) libtheora 1.1
  5) libasound
  6) libvorbis
  7) libvorbisenc
  8) libjpeg

Under Debian/Ubuntu all the dependencies should be satisfied by installing the
following packages:

build-essential libsdl1.2-dev libtheora-dev libasound2-dev libvorbis-dev
libvorbisenc2 libjpeg62-dev

You can compile the sources simply with:

$ make

or if you don't need the SDL version, with:

$ make USE_SDL=0

hwebcam uses simd optimizations for some functions on the x86 architecture. To
enable these optimizations compile hwebcam like this:

$ make ARCH=X86_64

Allowed values of ARCH are: X86_32, X86_64, generic (which is the default).

If you want to clean the build directory just run:

$ make clean

The resulting binary can be put, for example, in /usr/local/bin or can be run
from the local directory.

3. Using hwebcam
----------------

You can access the help by running:

$ ./hwebcam -h

The values in parentheses on the right are the default values.
Here's some command line examples:

  * Display captured video in a sdl window:
    ./hwebcam -w
  * As previous command, but enable verbose mode:
    ./hwebcam -w -v
  * Even more verbose:
    ./hwebcam -w -v -v
  * Select video device, frame size and frame rate:
    ./hwebcam -w -v -d /dev/video1 -s 352x288 -i 20
  * Save a picture every 10 seconds:
    ./hwebcam -w -t 10
  * As previous, but capture in mjpeg mode:
    ./hwebcam -w -t 10 -f mjpeg
  * Capture a 15 fps video and save it to an Ogg file:
    ./hwebcam -w -i 15 -e
  * As previous command, but choose filename and quality:
    ./hwebcam -w -i 15 -e -q 48 -o video.ogg
  * Capture audio and video:
    ./hwebcam -w -e -q 48 -a -D hw:1,0 -Q 0.3 -o avstream.ogg

4. Live streaming

Please read STREAMING-HOWTO if you want to stream the captured video with
icecast.
