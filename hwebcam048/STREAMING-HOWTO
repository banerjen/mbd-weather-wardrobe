Simple Streaming-howto using hwebcam + oggfwd + icecast2:

1) Install icecast2 and oggfwd with:
   sudo apt-get install icecast2 oggfwd
2) Edit /etc/icecast2/icecast.xml and change:
   limits/burst-size: 131072 (only for high bitrate streams, otherwise 65536 is fine)
   authentication/passwords
   hostname
   listen-socket/port (if you need a different port)
3) Edit /etc/default/icecast2 and set ENABLE=true
4) Start the icecast2 server with:
   sudo /etc/init.d/icecast2 start
5) Start capturing with hwebcam and send the stream to the
   server using oggfwd (you need to substitute PORT and PASS
   with the correct values in the command below):

   ./hwebcam -d /dev/video1 -s 352x288 -i 10 -w -e -o - | oggfwd -n Webcam -d "Webcam test" localhost PORT PASS /webcam.ogg

   This will capture a 352x288@10fps stream from /dev/video1,
   display it on a sdl window, encode the stream to Ogg/Theora
   and dump the encoded file to stdout. oggfwd will read from
   stdin and forward the stream to the server using the mountpoint
   /webcam.ogg, setting name and description of the stream to
   "Webcam" and "Webcam test" respectively.
6) Fire up a Ogg/Theora compatible browser (like Firefox or
   Chromium) and point it to:

   http://localhost:PORT/webcam.ogg

   you should be able to see the streaming video. Or, you can of
   course use your favourite video player, like totem, vlc, ffplay
   or mplayer to watch the stream.
